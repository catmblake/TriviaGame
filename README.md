# TriviaGame
This application is a timed, multiple choice trivia game using JavaScript logic and jQuery to manipulate the html. Bootstrap is used for style and responsiveness. Once the player clicks to start the quiz they have 30 seconds to answer all of the questions. The user's results are displayed when they click to submit their answers or when the 30 seconds have lapsed.
